# Bit Big Integer Algorithm v. 0.0.2

BBIA is a try to create fast and language independent algorithm which can save Nbit integer.

## Releases
First release will be in 24 january of 2019

## Syntax
Algorithm will be written in C language syntax.
Some languages don't have unsigned integer type, so was created
[Signed To Unsigned and Arithmetic Algorithm for BBIA](https://github.com/bgoncharuck/stuaa)

## Languages
**Before release, any working code can be found in Algorithm subfolder.**
If you try to use other realizations (languages) that will not work.

It will support any statically typed language.
I will add simple port to C (unsigned ver), Java, C# and JavaScript(TypeScript) for every release.
Will be added Rust version. You are free to add other languages.

## What works for now?
* STUAA (bitflag, shiftr, outofbounders)
* bitflag, multi bitflag
* bits fulll/empty till
* **bitshift right, bitshift left**
* bbia and integer sum
* bbia and integer dif
* **bbia and integer mult**
* bbia and bbia sum, mult
