# Bit Big Integer Algorithm v. 0.0.1

BBIA is a try to create fast and language independent algorithm which can save Nbit integer.

## Releases
First release will be in 24 january of 2019

## Syntax
Algorithm will be written in C language syntax.
Some languages don't have unsigned integer type, so was created
[Signed To Unsigned and Arithmetic Algorithm for BBIA](https://github.com/bgoncharuck/stuaa)

## Languages
It will support any statically typed language.
I will add simple port to C (unsigned ver), Java, C# and TypeScript for every release.
You are free to add other languages.

Before release, any working code can be found in Algorithm subfolder.
If you try to use other realizations that will not work.
